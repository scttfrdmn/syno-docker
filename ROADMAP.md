# syno-docker Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development phases for syno-docker, focusing on expanding from comprehensive Docker management to advanced Synology-specific features and operational capabilities.

## Current Status: **100% Docker API Coverage** ‚úÖ

**syno-docker v0.2.1** achieves complete Docker API coverage with 25+ commands covering:
- ‚úÖ Container Lifecycle (run, ps, start, stop, restart, rm)
- ‚úÖ Container Operations (logs, exec, stats, inspect)
- ‚úÖ Image Management (pull, images, rmi, export, import)
- ‚úÖ Volume Management (volume ls/create/rm/inspect/prune)
- ‚úÖ Network Management (network ls/create/rm/inspect/connect/disconnect/prune)
- ‚úÖ System Operations (system df/info/prune)
- ‚úÖ Multi-container Deployment (deploy with docker-compose)

## Planned Development Phases

### **Phase 5: Enhanced Compose Operations** üéØ
**Target: v0.3.0 (Q4 2025)**

**Objective**: Transform basic `deploy` into comprehensive compose lifecycle management.

#### **Commands to Add:**
```bash
# Compose lifecycle management
syno-docker compose up [SERVICE...]     # Start services
syno-docker compose down [PROJECT]      # Stop and remove services
syno-docker compose restart [SERVICE]   # Restart specific services
syno-docker compose pause/unpause       # Pause/unpause services

# Compose operations
syno-docker compose ps [PROJECT]        # List compose services
syno-docker compose logs [SERVICE]      # Service-specific logs
syno-docker compose exec [SERVICE] CMD  # Execute in compose service
syno-docker compose top [SERVICE]       # Show running processes

# Compose management
syno-docker compose pull [SERVICE]      # Pull service images
syno-docker compose build [SERVICE]     # Build services (if Dockerfile)
syno-docker compose config              # Validate and view compose config
```

#### **Enhanced Features:**
- **Service-level operations**: Target specific services within compose projects
- **Project management**: List, switch between, and manage multiple compose projects
- **Health monitoring**: Track service health and dependencies
- **Rolling updates**: Zero-downtime service updates
- **Environment management**: Better handling of multiple environment files

#### **Use Cases Addressed:**
- Development workflows with multiple services
- Production deployments with blue/green updates
- Service-specific debugging and maintenance
- Complex multi-container application management

---

### **Phase 6: Multi-NAS Support** üåê
**Target: v0.4.0 (Q1 2026)**

**Objective**: Enable management of multiple Synology NAS devices from a single CLI.

#### **Profile System:**
```bash
# Profile management
syno-docker profile add production --host nas1.local --user admin
syno-docker profile add staging --host nas2.local --user admin
syno-docker profile add development --host nas3.local --user scttfrdmn
syno-docker profile list
syno-docker profile set-default production

# Profile-specific operations
syno-docker --profile staging ps
syno-docker --profile production deploy app.yml
syno-docker profile sync development production  # Copy containers
```

#### **Cross-NAS Operations:**
```bash
# Container migration
syno-docker migrate web-server --from production --to staging
syno-docker backup create --profile production --all-containers
syno-docker backup restore backup.tar --to staging

# Multi-NAS monitoring
syno-docker stats --all-profiles
syno-docker ps --profile "*"  # All profiles
```

#### **Configuration:**
```yaml
# ~/.syno-docker/profiles.yaml
profiles:
  production:
    host: nas1.local
    user: admin
    ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/prod_rsa
  staging:
    host: nas2.local
    user: admin
    ssh_key_path: ~/.ssh/staging_rsa
default_profile: production
```

#### **Use Cases Addressed:**
- Production/staging/development environments
- Container migration between NAS devices
- Multi-site deployments
- Centralized management of multiple devices

---

### **Phase 7: Health Monitoring & Operations** üìä
**Target: v0.5.0 (Q2 2026)**

**Objective**: Advanced operational capabilities for production environments.

#### **Health & Monitoring:**
```bash
# Container health
syno-docker health [CONTAINER]          # Health check status
syno-docker events --follow             # Real-time Docker events
syno-docker top [CONTAINER]             # Running processes in container

# Advanced monitoring
syno-docker monitor start               # Start monitoring daemon
syno-docker monitor dashboard           # Launch monitoring dashboard
syno-docker monitor alerts              # Configure alerting
```

#### **Backup & Recovery:**
```bash
# Automated backup workflows
syno-docker backup schedule daily --containers "*" --volumes
syno-docker backup create production-backup --include-config
syno-docker backup list --remote s3://my-bucket
syno-docker backup restore latest --selective web-server,database

# Disaster recovery
syno-docker disaster-recovery plan create
syno-docker disaster-recovery test
syno-docker disaster-recovery execute
```

#### **Resource Management:**
```bash
# Resource constraints
syno-docker run nginx --memory 512m --cpus 0.5 --swap 1g
syno-docker update web-server --memory 1g --cpus 1.0
syno-docker quota set --max-containers 50 --max-memory 8g

# Resource monitoring
syno-docker resources overview
syno-docker resources alerts --threshold cpu=80% memory=90%
```

#### **Use Cases Addressed:**
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Automated backup strategies
- Resource optimization and constraints
- Operational visibility and control
